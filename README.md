# mithril

A verifying node for the Solana blockchain, implemented in Go. Forked from Radiance, which was built by Richard Patel (@ripatel)

This project is under active development. Our aim is to move rapidly with Mithril's development, hence all code is likely to be incomplete, buggy, and/or improperly tested at any particular point in time. Please check the dev branch for the latest version of the codebase. We'll begin to add documentation as Mithril begins to approach a useable state.
